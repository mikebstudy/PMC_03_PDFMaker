# 03.PDFMaker Project
- From Python Mega Course (by Ardit Sulce)
- Portfolio like showcase project
- Day 24 - Project 3 - Build a Python PDF Maker 

- Three separate implementations 
  - course_C is from working the lessons
  - mikeb_M is enhanced implementation based on my own ideas and those of others on the internet
  - Gemini_A is experiments in generating code similiar to course.C and mikeb.M
  - (C,M,A - are the letters that proceed git commit comments and correspond to the respective implementations)
